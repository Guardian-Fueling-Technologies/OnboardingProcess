Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Git: For cloning the repository.

Python 3.8+: For the Flask backend.

It's recommended to use pip for Python package management.

Node.js (LTS recommended): For the React frontend.

It's recommended to use npm or yarn for Node package management.

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

Bash

cd backend
Create a Python virtual environment:

Bash

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

macOS/Linux:

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
Windows (Command Prompt):

Bash

venv\Scripts\activate.bat
Windows (PowerShell):

Bash

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Install backend dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the backend/ directory with necessary configurations (e.g., FLASK_APP, FLASK_ENV, database connection strings).

# Example .env for Flask backend
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///instance/database.db
# Add any other sensitive keys here
Initialize the database (if applicable):

Bash

flask db upgrade # If using Flask-Migrate
# Or run a script to create tables if no migrations are used
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

Bash

cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies:

Bash

npm install # or yarn install
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env.development file in the frontend/ directory. This is where you'll define variables like the backend API URL.

# Example .env.development for React frontend
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
(Note: React requires variables to be prefixed with REACT_APP_)

Running the Application
Make sure both the backend and frontend are set up as described above.

Start the Backend (in a separate terminal):
Ensure your virtual environment is active.

Bash

cd backend
flask run
# The backend will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Start the Frontend (in another separate terminal):

Bash

cd frontend
npm start # or yarn start
# The frontend will typically open in your browser on http://localhost:3000
The React frontend will proxy API requests to the Flask backend based on the REACT_APP_API_URL you configured.

API Endpoints
(This section should list your backend API endpoints, their methods, and expected request/response formats. Example below.)

Endpoint

Method

Description

Request Body Example

Response Body Example

/api/employees

GET

Deployment
(This section should briefly describe how to deploy your application. Common options include:)

Option 1: Flask serving React's build folder:

Build the React app: cd frontend && npm run build.

Configure Flask static_folder and static_url_path to serve the frontend/build directory (as shown in previous conversations).

Deploy the entire Flask application (e.g., using Gunicorn/Waitress and a web server like Nginx on a VPS, or directly to a PaaS like Heroku/Render).

Option 2: Separate deployments:

Deploy the React app to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

Deploy the Flask API to a separate backend hosting service (e.g., Heroku, Render, AWS EC2).

Ensure the REACT_APP_API_URL in the frontend's production environment points to the deployed Flask API URL.

(Provide more specific instructions based on your chosen deployment platform if known.)
